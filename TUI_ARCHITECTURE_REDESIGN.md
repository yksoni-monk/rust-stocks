# TUI Architecture Redesign Progress

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed Components:
1. **Centralized Layout Management** (`src/ui/layout.rs`)
   - `TuiLayout` for main app layout (tab bar, content, status bar)
   - `ViewLayout` for view-specific sub-layouts
   - Methods for rendering common UI elements and splitting areas

2. **Async State Management** (`src/ui/state.rs`)
   - `AsyncStateManager` for tracking operations, managing logs, and communicating state changes
   - `AppState`, `StateUpdate`, `LogLevel`, `AsyncOperation`, `CompletedOperation`, `LogMessage` enums/structs
   - Broadcast channel for state communication

3. **Unified Event System** (`src/ui/events.rs`)
   - `TuiEvent` enum for all events
   - `EventManager` for sending/receiving events
   - `EventHandler` trait (sync-compatible) for views
   - `GlobalEventHandler` for terminal events
   - `EventRouter` for routing
   - `EventLoop` for main event processing

4. **View Contract** (`src/ui/view.rs`)
   - `View` trait (sync-compatible) with methods like `render`, `get_title`, `get_status`, `handle_key`, `handle_state_update`, `update`
   - `ViewManager` to handle multiple views
   - `BaseView` as a default implementation

   - Implements proper view switching with Tab/BackTab navigation
   - Replaces old view system with new architecture

2. **Updated Main Entry Point** (`src/main.rs`)
   - Updated to use `app_new::run_app_async` instead of old app
   - Maintains same configuration and database initialization
   - Seamless transition to new architecture

### âœ… Key Features Implemented:
