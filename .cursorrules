# Cursor Rules

## Database Rules
- CRITICAL: Database changes MUST use sqlx migrations only.
  - NEVER run direct SQL (ALTER TABLE/UPDATE/CREATE/DROP) against the DB from the terminal or ad-hoc scripts.
  - Use files under `db/migrations/` and run via `sqlx migrate run --database-url "sqlite:src-tauri/db/stocks.db" --source db/migrations`.
  - If a manual hotfix is unavoidable, first create a migration file, then apply it via the migration runner. No exceptions.
  - Update/validate dependent views (e.g., `v_data_freshness_summary`) in the same migration when schema changes affect them.
  - Make a backup before migrations when touching critical tables (use the existing `DatabaseManager::create_backup`).
  - After migration, compile and run a freshness check to validate (`cargo check` and app status call).

## Project Structure Rules
- Working directory is ALWAYS ROOT: `/Users/yksoni/code/misc/rust-stocks`
- Frontend is in `src/` (SolidJS TypeScript components)
- Backend is in `src-tauri/src/` (Rust code)
- Database is in `src-tauri/db/stocks.db` (2.5GB PRODUCTION DATABASE)
- Migrations are in `src-tauri/db/migrations/`
- Backups are in `src-tauri/db/backups/`

## API Contract Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- NEVER modify backend function signatures without checking all frontend callers
- ALWAYS use consistent naming: `snake_case` in Rust, map to `camelCase` in frontend
- ALWAYS validate parameter names match between frontend invoke() and backend function
- ALWAYS verify return types match between frontend expectations and backend reality
- ALWAYS make database field names match API struct field names exactly
- NEVER use different field names between database schema and API models
- ALWAYS use proper serde mapping for camelCase conversion

## Testing Requirements
- ALWAYS run integration tests for API changes: `cargo test && cd src && npm test`
- NEVER claim something is "fixed" without testing the actual user flow
- ALWAYS test frontend-backend communication end-to-end

## Before Any API Change Checklist
- [ ] Check frontend API calls match backend function signatures
- [ ] Verify parameter names are consistent (startDate → start_date mapping)
- [ ] Confirm return types match frontend expectations
- [ ] Test the actual user flow, not just unit tests
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces if backend structs change

## TypeScript Rules
- TS bindings: Do not create manual TS types for backend-shared structs. Use `ts-rs` generated bindings only.
- Generated files: Never edit files under `solid_frontend/src/api` (generated).

## NEVER DO THESE THINGS
- ❌ Look for database in ROOT - it's in `src-tauri/db/stocks.db`
- ❌ Put migrations in root - they belong in `src-tauri/db/migrations/`
- ❌ Confuse frontend (src/) with backend (src-tauri/src/)
- ❌ Create databases or migrations outside proper directories
- ❌ Change API contracts without checking both sides
- ❌ Use different field names between database and API models
- ❌ Run direct SQL commands against production database
