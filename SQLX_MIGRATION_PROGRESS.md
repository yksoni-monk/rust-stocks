# SQLX Migration Progress Tracker

## 📊 Migration Overview
**Goal**: Complete migration from `rusqlite` to `sqlx` for better async support and modern Rust patterns
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks of focused work
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Breaking changes across entire codebase

## 🎯 Migration Strategy
**Approach**: Complete replacement - cannot have both libraries due to SQLite linking conflicts
**Method**: Phase-by-phase migration with comprehensive testing at each stage

## 📋 Phase Breakdown

- 🎉 Phase 2 completed successfully!

#### Current Focus:
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Analysis module (simpler, good starting point)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Data collector module (core functionality)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Concurrent fetcher module (complex async patterns)

#### Analysis Module Results:
- ✅ Stock search: Found 4 stocks matching "AAPL"
- ✅ Summary stats: 503 stocks, 387,643 price records
- ✅ P/E analysis: Working correctly (0 stocks with P/E decline due to data limitations)
- ✅ Stock details: Successfully retrieved 250 price records for AAPL
- ✅ All async database operations working correctly

#### Data Collector Module Results:
- ✅ Stock operations: Successfully inserted and retrieved test stock
- ✅ Database stats: 503 stocks, 387,643 price records, 1,425 unique dates
- ✅ Metadata operations: Working correctly
- ✅ Price operations: Successfully retrieved latest price for A ($125.21)
- ✅ All async database operations working correctly

#### Concurrent Fetcher Module Results:
- ✅ Configuration: Working correctly (date range, threads, retry attempts)
- ✅ Database operations: count_existing_records, get_latest_price working
- ✅ Metadata operations: Working correctly
- ✅ Database stats: 504 stocks, 387,643 price records, 1,425 unique dates
- ✅ All async database operations working correctly

### **Phase 3: Application Code Migration**
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Re-enable UI module and integrate all components

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Re-enable UI module with SQLX
- [ ] Update main.rs to use all modules
- [ ] Fix UI database integration
- [ ] Test full application functionality
- [ ] Validate TUI operations
- [ ] Ensure all features work together

#### Progress Notes:
- 🔄 Starting UI module re-enabling
- ✅ All core modules migrated and working
- ✅ Database operations validated
- ❌ Need to integrate UI with SQLX database
- ❌ Need to update main.rs to use all modules

#### Current Focus:
- **Priority 1**: UI module re-enabling
- **Priority 2**: Main application integration
- **Priority 3**: Full application testing

### **Phase 4: Test Infrastructure Migration**
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Update all tests to use async database operations

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Update test database utilities
- [ ] Convert all unit tests to async
- [ ] Convert all integration tests to async
- [ ] Update test helper functions
- [ ] Comprehensive test validation

### **Phase 5: Performance Optimization & Cleanup**
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Optimize performance and clean up code

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Optimize connection pooling
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
- [ ] Remove old rusqlite code
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Rollback Plan**
- Keep git commits at each phase
- Maintain backup of working rusqlite implementation
- Test thoroughly before proceeding to next phase

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for each database operation
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests to ensure no regression
- Manual testing of TUI functionality

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Success Criteria**
- [ ] SQLX implementation compiles without errors
- [ ] All basic CRUD operations work
- [ ] Tests pass with SQLX implementation
- [ ] No functionality regression

### **Overall Success Criteria**
- [ ] All existing functionality works with SQLX
- [ ] Performance is at least as good as rusqlite
- [ ] Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- [ ] Better async support throughout codebase

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### **SQLX Query Strategy**
- **Decision**: Use raw SQL queries instead of query macros
- **Reason**: More flexible, easier to debug, fewer type issues
- **Trade-off**: Less compile-time safety, but more control

### **Migration Strategy**
- **Decision**: Complete replacement, not gradual migration
- **Reason**: Cannot have both libraries due to SQLite linking conflicts
- **Risk**: Higher risk, but cleaner end result

## 📝 Notes & Lessons Learned

### **Key Insights**
1. SQLX query macros are very strict about types and schema
2. Raw SQL approach is more flexible for complex queries
3. DATE type in SQLite is problematic with SQLX - need careful handling
4. Migration is more complex than initially estimated

### **Challenges Encountered**
1. SQLite linking conflicts between rusqlite and sqlx
2. DATE type not supported in SQLX query macros
3. Complex type conversions between database and Rust types
4. Widespread impact across entire codebase

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Remove rusqlite dependency completely
2. Fix all compilation errors
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Validate SQLX implementation works with existing data

### **Phase 1 Completion Checklist**
- [ ] Remove rusqlite from Cargo.toml
- [ ] Fix all compilation errors
- [ ] Test SQLX implementation with existing database
- [ ] Create basic test suite
- [ ] Validate all core operations work
- [ ] Document any issues or workarounds needed
