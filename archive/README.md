# Project Archive

This directory contains archived files that were useful during development but are no longer needed in the main project directory.

## Archive Contents

### üìÅ sqlx_migration/
Contains documentation files from the SQLX migration process (September 2025):
- Migration analysis and planning documents
- Progress tracking files
- Strategy documents
- Fix plans and scripts

### üìÅ debug_logs/
Contains debug log files from data collection testing (August-September 2025):
- Debug logs for various stock symbols
- API call logs
- Data processing logs
- **NEW**: All future debug logs from TUI data collection are automatically created here

## Purpose

These archives are maintained for:
- **Historical reference** - Understanding how the project evolved
- **Debugging reference** - Past issues and their solutions
- **Migration guidance** - Future similar migrations can reference these patterns
- **Development context** - Understanding the development process

## Access

All files in this archive are read-only and should not be modified. They serve as a historical record of the project's development journey.

## Current Usage

The `debug_logs/` directory is actively used by the application to store new debug log files during data collection operations.
